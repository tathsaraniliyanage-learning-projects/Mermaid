# Mermaid - Diagramming and charting tool

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that enables users to create diagrams directly from text definitions. It helps visualize documentation, workflows, and complex data, making it especially useful for developers, project managers, and anyone working with structured data. With Mermaid, you can easily create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, class diagrams, and more.



## Features:

Flowcharts: Easily define flowcharts to visualize processes.
Sequence Diagrams: Describe interactions between objects in a sequence.
Gantt Charts: Plan and manage projects with Gantt charts.
Class Diagrams: Create object-oriented class structures.
Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs): Visualize database relationships.
Live Preview: Real-time diagram preview as you write definitions.
Integration Friendly: Supports embedding in Markdown, GitHub, GitLab, and more.
